                    Hi! I'm a software engineer that loves to create staff for the internet.
                    It all started with a Hello World program in my command line and grew in a passion for creating unique experience. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since graduating in early 2021 with a B.Sc. in Computer Science, I have focus on learning the ropes of being a fullstack web developper.
                    I especially like front end development because it is beautiful mixture of arts and engineering. The creative freedom it offers talks a lot to my creative side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently working on improving my design skills, by taking inspiration from awwwards submissions, and developpers such as Aristide Benoist, Benjamin Code, Wrong Akram, and Kevin Powell just cite a few.
                    I'm also learning Ruby on Rails with the Odin Project course.
