# DESCRIPTION
Personal portfolio to showcase myself as a developer and journal my growth as a developer.
# GOAL
Create a website that will showcase the latest project I worked on.
# SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED
Site built with NextJs, styled with SCSS, and the animation are built with the GSAP library.
# FUTURE IMPROVEMENT
Add a content management system (CMS) to manage projects, and image resources. 
Implementing a CMS will also simplify future updates in either the projects list or 
updating images that are in use on the website.
