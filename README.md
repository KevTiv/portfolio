# DESCRIPTION
Personal portfolio to showcase me as a developer and journal my growth as a developer.
# GOAL
Create a website that will showcase the latest project I worked on.
# SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED
Site built with NextJs styled with SCSS, and the animations are built with the GSAP library.
# FUTURE IMPROVEMENT
- Add a content management system (CMS) to manage projects, and image resources. 
- Implementing a CMS will also simplify future updates in either the projects list or 
updating images that are in use on the website.
